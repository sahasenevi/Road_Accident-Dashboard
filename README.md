🚗📊 Car Accident Dashboard | Power BI Project

I developed an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to analyze road accident trends and support data-driven decision making for improved road safety. 🚦

The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators such as:
🔹 Total Accidents
🔹 Casualties
🔹 Accident Severity
🔹 Time-Based Trends
🔹 Location Hotspots
🔹 Vehicle Categories
🔹 Weather & Road Conditions

Users can explore the data using dynamic filters, slicers, and drill-down features to uncover hidden patterns and identify high-risk areas. 🔍
